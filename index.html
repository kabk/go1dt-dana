  <p.class="italic">Across the way from our apartment-on Houston, I guess-there's a new wall ad. The site 
 is forty feet high, twenty feet wide. It changes once or twice a year. Whatever's on that
 wall is my view: I look at it more than the sky or the new World Trade Center, more than 
 the water towers, the passing cabs. It has a subliminal effect. Last semester it was a 
 spot for high-end vodka, and while I wrangled children into their snowsuits, chock-full 
 of domestic resentment, I'd find myself dreaming of cold martinis.</p>
 
 <p>Before that came an ad so high-end I couldn't tell what it was for. There was no 
 text-or none that I could see-and the visual was of a yellow firebird set upon a 
 background of hellish red. It seemed a gnomic message, deliberately placed to drive a 
 sleepless woman mad. Once, staring at it with a newborn in my arms, I saw another mother,
 in the tower opposite, holding her baby.It was 4 AM. We stood there at our respective 
 windows, separated by a hundred feet of expensive New York air.</p></div>

<div class="section" id="section2">
	    	<div class="intro">
<p>The tower I live in is university accommodation; so is the tower opposite.
 The idea occurred that it was quite likely that the woman at the window also wrote books 
 for a living, and, like me, was not writing anything right now. Maybe she was considering 
 antidepressants. Maybe she was already on them. It was hard to tell. Certainly she had no 
 way of viewing the ad in question, not without opening her window, jumping, and turning as 
 she fell. I was her view. I was the ad for what she already had.</p>
 
 <p>But that was all some time ago. Now the ad says: Find your beach. The bottle of beer-it's
  an ad for beer-is very yellow and the background luxury-holiday-blue. It seems to me 
  uniquely well placed, like a piece of commissioned public art in perfect sympathy with 
  its urban site. The tone is pure Manhattan. Echoes can be found in the personal growth
   section of the bookstore ("Find your happy"), and in exercise classes ("Find your soul"),
    and in the therapist"s office ("Find your self"). I find it significant that there 
    exists a more expansive, national version of this ad that runs in magazines, 
    and on television.</p>
<div class="image"><div name="imageTitle><h1 class="title">Find Your Beach</div>
<a name="FindYourBeach.jpg"</a>	
</div> <!-- .image --><img src="FindYourBeach.jpg" style="width:600px;height:350px"></img>
<p>In those cases photographic images are used, and the beach is real 
    and seen in full. Sometimes the tag line is expanded, too: When life gives you
     limes…Find your beach. But the wall I see from my window marks the entrance to Soho,
      a district that is home to media moguls, entertainment lawyers, every variety of 
      celebrity, some students, as well as a vanishingly small subset of rent-controlled 
      artists and academics.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="section3">
	    	<div class="intro">
<p>Collectively we, the people of Soho, consider ourselves pretty
       sophisticated consumers of media. You can't put a cheesy ad like that past us. 
       And so the ad has been reduced to its essence-a yellow undulation against a field 
       of blue-and painted directly onto the wall, in a bright pop-art style. The mad men 
       know that we know the Soho being referenced here: the Soho of Roy Lichtenstein and 
       Ivan Karp, the Soho that came before Foot Locker, Sephora, Prada, frozen yogurt. 
       That Soho no longer exists, of course, but it's part of the reason we're all here, 
       crowded on this narrow strip of a narrow island. Whoever placed this ad knows us well.</p>
<p>Find your beach. The construction is odd. A faintly threatening mixture of imperative and 
possessive forms, the transformation of a noun into a state of mind. Perhaps I'm reading 
too much into it. On the one hand it means, simply, "Go out and discover what makes you 
happy." Pursue happiness actively, as Americans believe it their right to do. And it's an 
ad for beer, which makes you happy in the special way of all intoxicants, by reshaping 
reality around a sensation you alone are having. So, even more precisely, the ad means: 
"Go have a beer and let it make you happy." Nothing strange there. Except beer used to be 
sold on the dream of communal fun: have a beer with a buddy, or lots of buddies. People 
crowded the frame, laughing and smiling. It was a lie about alcohol-as this ad is a lie 
about alcohol-but it was a different kind of lie, a wide-framed lie, including other people.</p>

<p>Here the focus is narrow, almost obsessive. Everything that is not absolutely necessary 
to your happiness has been removed from the visual horizon. The dream is not only of happiness,
 but of happiness conceived in perfect isolation. Find your beach in the middle of the city. 
 Find your beach no matter what else is happening. Do not be distracted from finding your 
 beach. Find your beach even if-as in the case of this wall painting-it is not actually 
 there. Create this beach inside yourself. Carry it with you wherever you go. The pursuit 
 of happiness has always seemed to me a somewhat heavy American burden, but in Manhattan 
 it is conceived as a peculiar form of duty.</p>
 
 <p>In an exercise class recently the instructor 
 shouted at me, at all of us: "Don't let your mind set limits that aren't really there." 
 You'll find this attitude all over the island. It is encouraged and reflected in the 
 popular culture, especially the movies, so many of which, after all, begin their creative
  lives here, in Manhattan. According to the movies it's only our own limited brains that 
  are keeping us from happiness. In the future we will take a pill to make us limitless 
  (and ideal citizens of Manhattan), or we will, like Scarlett Johansson in Lucy, use 100 
  percent of our brain's capacity instead of the mythic 10. In these formulations the world 
  as it is has no real claim on us. Our happiness, our miseries, our beaches, or our 
  blasted heaths—they are all within our own power to create, or destroy. On Tina Fey's 
  television show 30 Rock, Jack Donaghy - the consummate citizen of this new Manhattan—deals 
  with problems by crushing them with his "mind vise."</p>
  <p>The beach is always there: you just 
  have to conceive of it. It follows that those who fail to find their beach are, in the 
  final analysis, mentally fragile; in Manhattan terms, simply weak. Jack Donaghy&#39;s verbal 
  swordplay with Liz Lemon was a comic rendering of the various things many citizens of 
  Manhattan have come to regard as fatal weakness: childlessness, obesity, poverty. To 
  find your beach you have to be ruthless. Manhattan is for the hard-bodied, the hard-minded, 
  the multitasker, the alpha mamas and papas. A perfect place for self-empowerment—as long 
  as you're pretty empowered to begin with. As long as you're one of these people who simply 
  do not allow anything-not even reality-to impinge upon that clear field of blue.</p>
  <p>There is 
  a kind of individualism so stark that it seems to dovetail with an existentialist creed: 
  Manhattan is right at that crossroads. You are pure potential in Manhattan, limitless, 
  you are making yourself every day. When I am in England each summer, it's the opposite: 
  all I see are the limits of my life. The brain that puts a hairbrush in the fridge, the 
  leg that radiates pain from the hip to the toe, the lovely children who eat all my time, 
  the books unread and unwritten.</p>
  <p>And casting a shadow over it all is what Philip Larkin 
  called "extinction's alp," no longer a stable peak in a distance, finally becoming rising 
  ground. In England even at the actual beach I cannot find my beach. I look out at the 
  freezing 40-degree water, at the families squeezed into ill-fitting wetsuits, huddled 
  behind windbreakers, approaching a day at the beach with the kind of stoicism once 
  conjured for things like the Battle of Britain, and all I can think is what funny, 
  limited creatures we are, subject to every wind and wave, building castles in the sand 
  that will only be knocked down by the generation coming up beneath us.</p>
  <p>When I land at JFK, 
  everything changes. For the first few days it is a shock: I have to get used to old New 
  York ladies beside themselves with fury that I have stopped their smooth elevator journey 
  and got in with some children. I have to remember not to pause while walking in the 
  street-or during any fluid-moving city interaction-unless I want to utterly exasperate 
  the person behind me. Each man and woman in this town is in pursuit of his or her beach 
  and God help you if you get in their way. 
  I suppose it should follow that I am happier 
  in pragmatic England than idealist Manhattan, but I can't honestly say that this is so. 
  You don't come to live here unless the delusion of a reality shaped around your own 
  desires isn’t a strong aspect of your personality. "A reality shaped around your own 
  desires"-there is something sociopathic in that ambition.</p>
  <p>It is also a fair description 
  of what it is to write fiction. And to live in a city where everyone has essentially 
  the same tunnel vision and obsessive focus as a novelist is to disguise your own 
  sociopathy among the herd. Objectively all the same limits are upon me in Manhattan 
  as they are in England. 
  I walk a ten-block radius every day, constrained in all the 
  usual ways by domestic life, reduced to writing about whatever is right in front of my 
  nose. But the fact remains that here I do write, the work gets done.</p>
  <p>Even if my Manhattan
   productivity is powered by a sociopathic illusion of my own limitlessness, I'm thankful 
   for it, at least when I'm writing. There's a reason so many writers once lived here, 
   beyond the convenient laundromats and the take-out food, the libraries and caf&#233;s. We 
   have always worked off the energy generated by this town, the money-making and 
   tower-building as much as the street art and underground cultures. Now the energy is 
   different: the underground has almost entirely disappeared. (You hope there are still 
   young artists in Washington Heights, in the Barrio, or Stuyvesant Town, but how much 
   longer can they hang on?) A twisted kind of energy radiates instead off the soulcycling 
   mothers and marathon-running octogenarians, the entertainment lawyers glued to their 
   iPhones and the moguls building five "individualized" condo townhouses where once there 
   was a hospital.</p>
   <p>It's not a pretty energy, but it still runs what's left of the show. 
   I contribute to it. I ride a stationary bike like the rest of them. And then I despair 
   when Shakespeare and Co. closes in favor of another Foot Locker. There's no way to be 
   in good faith on this island anymore. You have to crush so many things with your mind 
   vise just to get through the day. Which seems to me another aspect of the ad outside 
   of my window: willful intoxication. Or to put it more snappily: "You don't have to be 
   high to live here, but it helps."</p>
   
<p>Finally the greatest thing about Manhattan is the worst thing about Manhattan: 
self-actualization. Here you will be free to stretch yourself to your limit, to find the 
beach that is yours alone. But sooner or later you will be sitting on that beach wondering 
what comes next. I can see my own beach ahead now, as the children grow, as the practical 
limits fade; I see afresh the huge privilege of my position; it reclarifies itself. Under 
the protection of a university I live on one of the most privileged strips of built-up 
beach in the world, among people who believe they have no limits and who push me, by their 
very proximity, into the same useful delusion, now and then.</p>
<p>It is such a good town in which to work and work. You can find your beach here, find it 
falsely, but convincingly, still thinking of Manhattan as an isle of writers and artists-of 
downtown underground wildlings and uptown intellectuals-against all evidence to the contrary. 
Oh, you still see them occasionally here and there, but unless they are under the protection 
of a university-or have sold that TV show-they are all of them, every single last one of them, 
in Brooklyn.</p></div>
